# react-nodeassignment
Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, React, and Material UI, Jest, Node, Express are all used in the development of this project. Users search for properties they're interested in, and filter them by city name,and company name. Their is a dynamic rouing using search params and useMemo, so that the data should remain even if user refreshes the page. In addition, pagination is also there with 3 data displayed per page . I used public API JSON data to mock an API call using Axios and other states handled locally.
